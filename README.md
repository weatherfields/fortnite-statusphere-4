Statusphere Check:
The stat check uses a third party API to let the user see how they're doing in the Fortnite Battle Royal. They can also see their match history, what's current in the FN store, and see active challenges.

Stat Chat & Forum:
In a further build these pages will be incorporated into one page. Not only will users be able to use a classic forum to discuss their favorite game, but they will also be able to direct message each other.
